** TODOs

- Add ERFA and CUTE to the root directory of the distribution.
- Update the CMakeLists.txt to reflect those changes and reduce hardcoding.

- The Boost-based Python API is deprecated and will be deleted soon.
-- The current PySTARE has tuple and list support.
-- The future PySTARE1 has a slightly different usage and no tuple/list support currently depending on Numpy. (See contrib/python examples.)
