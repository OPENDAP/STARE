* 2019-0808 Version X

- Rename PySTARE1 to PySTARE.

- PySTARE has a slightly different usage and no tuple/list support
   currently depending on Numpy. (See contrib/python examples.)

* 2019-08-06 Version 0.6.1

Minor modifications. Build improvements. PySTARE and Boost removed.
Corrected NOTES and INSTALL documentation.

* 2019-07-03 Version 0.5.0

- Added ERFA single file and CUTE. Cf. 6/19.
- Tests for SWIG.
- Added integer-based "contains," i.e. cmpSpatial.

- ERFA provides datum mappings for precise positioning in time. We should
  take advantage of this when we need to associate longitude and time.

** TODOs

- Add ERFA and CUTE to the root directory of the distribution.
- Update the CMakeLists.txt to reflect those changes and reduce hardcoding.

- A number of classes & files have a "1" at the end of their names This
  generally indicates a need to refactor as the "1" is either a
  derived class or an evolution meant to replace older code.

- The TemporalIndex hierarchy of classes needs more thought. Currently
  the default type is #2 and different implementations for the other
  types is left for the future.

** ODDITIES

- The HTM spatial libraries, in particular the SkipList code used for
  spatial ranges and covers expects negative index values to indicate 
  invalid indices. Therefore the STARE spatial index must be positive
  and the most significant bit is not used.
