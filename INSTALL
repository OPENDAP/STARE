Notes on installation.

The environment variable TOPDIR is set to the top level of the
distribution. CUTE-based unit testing is the default, set CUTEDIR to
CUTE's location.

# In TOPDIR, construct the makefile. The configure script uses uname
# to try to determine which platform we're on.
$ ./configure
$ make

The object files and library archive (libSTARE.a) are in the 'unix' directory.

To use the library, include the files in 'include' and link to 'libSTARE.a'.
