# CMake build 
#
# Out-of-source build. Assume ./STARE is the TOPDIR.
# 
# Products:
#   libSTARE.a and PySTARE.so (if built) will be in build/default/src
#   tests will be in build/default/tests
#   ./STARE/include contains the headers
#

# The default location for CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is /usr/local (UNIX)
#	or c:/Program Files (Windows). Running the below cmake command will
#	set it to $prefix/deps. If you wish to install it elsewhere, simply
#	set the environment variable to your preferred location.

# The PYTHON_INCLUDE_DIRS environment variable can be set to the locations
# of python and numpy/core include directories. See src/CMakeLists.txt for
# how the include_directories is set.

mkdir build; cd build
cmake ../STARE
make

# To make a source distribution after running cmake...

make dist

# To install the include files and library, try the following.

mkdir build; cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=< install_path > .. 
make install

# To run tests, after making the library as above, try the following
# in the build directory.
