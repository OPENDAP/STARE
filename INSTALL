# INSTALL

Notes on installation.

The environment variable TOPDIR is set to the top level of the
distribution. CUTE-based unit testing is the default.

There are now two methods for compiling STARE. The currently preferred
method is based on CMake and the second (deprecated) uses an old ad hoc
shell script.

Dependencies:
  Python3, Boost::Python: for PySTARE

########################################################################### 
#
# METHOD 1 CMake (Preferred)
#
# Out-of-source build. Assume ./STARE is the TOPDIR.
# 
# Products:
#   libSTARE.a and PySTARE.so (if built) will be in build/default/src
#   tests will be in build/default/tests
#   ./STARE/include contains the headers
#
# The default location for CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is /usr/local (UNIX)
#	or c:/Program Files (Windows). Running the below cmake command will
#	set it to $prefix/deps. If you wish to install it elsewhere, simply
#	set the environment variable to your preferred location.
# The environment variable "CUTE_INCLUDE_DIR" has a default value of:
#	'${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/CUTE_DIR/CUTE'
#	If you want to use a different location for the CUTE headers you
#	must provide it with the cmake command using
#	'-DCUTE_INCLUDE_DIR=<CUTE location>'

$ mkdir build; cd build
$ cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$prefix/deps
$ make

#
# METHOD 2 Configure + Make (Deprecated)
#
# In TOPDIR, construct the makefile. The configure script uses uname
# to try to determine which platform we're on.
$ ./configure
$ make

The object files and library archive (libSTARE.a) are in the 'unix' directory.

To use the library, include the files in 'include' and link to 'libSTARE.a'.
